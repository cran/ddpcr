<div id="implementation-technical-details" class="section level1">
<h1>Implementation technical details</h1>
<p>The <em>ddpcr</em> package makes extensive use of the S3 class
inheritance system in R. The plate object is implemented as an S3 object
of class <code>ddpcr_plate</code> with the R <code>list</code> as its
base type. S3 objects are used for two main purposes: to override the
behaviour of some base R functions when applied to plate objects, and to
allow plate objects to inherit characteristics of other plate
objects.</p>
<div id="a-plate-object-is-a-list" class="section level2">
<h2>A plate object is a list</h2>
<p>Every S3 object has a base type upon which it is built. The base type
of a plate object is a list, as it allows for an easy way to bundle
together the several different R objects describing a plate into one.
All information required to analyze a plate is part of the plate object.
Every plate object contains the following nine items:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>plate_data</strong> - A data.frame containing the
fluorescence amplitude values and the cluster assignment for each
droplet. The fluorescence values remain static throughout an analysis,
while the cluster assignments start as “undefined” and are assigned
specific clusters during the analysis.</li>
<li><strong>plate_meta</strong> - A data.frame containing the metadata
information about each well. Each analysis step adds more variables to
the metadata.</li>
<li><strong>name</strong> - A string representing the name of the
dataset.</li>
<li><strong>status</strong> - An integer indicating the number of steps
in the analysis pipeline that the plate has already run through.</li>
<li><strong>params</strong> - A list containing all the parameters used
in the analysis algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>clusters</strong> - A vector of names of all the possible
clusters a droplet can be assigned to. For example, any plate with a
PN/PP type has seven possible clusters: undefined (a droplet that has
not been analyzed yet), failed (a droplet in a failed well), outlier,
empty, rain, positive (PP), negative (PN).</li>
<li><strong>steps</strong> - A named list containing the steps required
to analyze the given plate. The name of each item in the list is a short
descriptive name of the analysis step, and the value is the name of the
function that contains the code to run the step. The items in the list
of steps are ordered in the same order that the analysis is carried
out.</li>
<li><strong>dirty</strong> - A Boolean flag indicating whether or not
the analysis parameters have been modified since the analysis was run.
If any parameters have changed, the <code>dirty</code> flag is set to
true and the user is informed that the plate should be re-analyzed in
order for the new parameters to take effect.</li>
<li><strong>version</strong> - A number representing the version of
<em>ddpcr</em> at the time of plate creation. This information is not
directly used by the program, but it can be useful when inspecting an
old plate object to know whether it was created with the most up to date
version of the package.</li>
</ul>
<p>Except for the version and dirty flag, all other seven items in the
plate’s list have corresponding getter and setter functions for
convenience. For example, the name of a dataset can be retrieved with a
call to <code>name(plate)</code> and can be modified with a call to
<code>name(plate) &lt;- &quot;my data&quot;</code>. The only information about a
plate object that is not inside the plate’s list is the plate type. The
plate’s type is already stored as the plate object’s class in order for
S3 to function, so including the plate type in the list would be
redundant.</p>
</div>
<div id="using-s3-for-plate-objects-to-override-base-generic-functions" class="section level2">
<h2>Using S3 for plate objects to override base generic functions</h2>
<p>Since the plate object is an S3 object, it can benefit from the use
of generic functions. There are three common generic functions that the
plate object implements: <code>print()</code>, <code>plot()</code>, and
<code>subset()</code>. The <code>print()</code> and <code>plot()</code>
generics are very often implemented for S3 classes, and they are
especially useful for plate objects. The <code>print()</code> method
does not take any extra arguments and is used to print a summary of a
plate object in a visually appealing way to the console. It gives an
overview of the most important parameters of the plate such as its type
and name, as well as the current analysis state of a plate. The
<code>plot()</code> method generates a scatterplot of every well in the
plate object and can be highly customizable using the many arguments it
implements. While the base <code>plot()</code> method uses base R
graphics, the <code>plot()</code> method for <code>ddpcr_plate</code>
objects uses the ‘ggplot2’ package. The <code>subset()</code> generic is
overridden by a method that can be called to retain a subset of wells
from a larger plate. The <code>subset()</code> method uses two
additional arguments, <code>wells</code> and <code>samples</code>, to
specify which wells to select.</p>
</div>
<div id="using-s3-for-plate-objects-to-support-inheritance" class="section level2">
<h2>Using S3 for plate objects to support inheritance</h2>
<p>Inheritance means that every plate type has a parent plate type from
which it inherits all its features, but specific behaviour can be added
or modified. In <em>ddpcr</em>, transitive inheritance is implemented,
which means that features are inherited from all ancestors rather than
only the most immediate one. Multiple inheritance is not supported,
meaning that each plate object can only have one parent.</p>
<p>The notion of inheritance is an important part of the <em>ddpcr</em>
package, as it allows ddPCR data from different assay types to share
many properties. For example, PN/PP assays are first treated using the
analysis steps common to all ddPCR experiments, and then gated with an
assay-specific step, so PN/PP assays can be thought of as inheriting the
analysis from general ddPCR assays. Furthermore, FAM-positive and
HEX-positive assays (defined in Section 2.1) are both PN/PP assays that
share many similarities, so they can be thought of as inheriting many
properties of a PN/PP assay. Another benefit of the <em>ddpcr</em>
inheritance is that it allows any user to easily extend the
functionality of the package by adding custom ddPCR plate types.</p>
</div>
<div id="analysis-of-different-built-in-plate-types" class="section level2">
<h2>Analysis of different built-in plate types</h2>
<p>The most basic plate type is <code>ddpcr_plate</code>, and every
plate type inherits from it, either directly or by inheriting from other
plate types that are descendants of <code>ddpcr_plate</code>. This is
useful because it means that all functionality that is common to all
ddPCR experiments is implemented once for <code>ddpcr_plate</code>, and
every other plate type automatically inherits all the methods that
<code>ddpcr_plate</code> has. When a new plate object is created (with
the <code>new_plate()</code> function) without specifying a plate type,
the <code>ddpcr_plate</code> type is assumed.</p>
<p>Calling the <code>analyze()</code> function on any plate will result
in running the ddPCR data through a series of steps that are defined for
the given plate type, and the read droplets will be assigned to one of
several clusters associated with the given plate type. The exact set of
analysis steps and potential clusters are determined by the plate type.
Plates of type <code>ddpcr_plate</code> have four possible droplet
clusters: “undefined” for any droplet that has not been assigned a
cluster yet, “failed” for droplets in failed wells, “outlier” for
outlier droplets, and “empty” for droplets without any template in them.
Plates of type <code>ddpcr_plate</code> have 4 analysis steps:
“INITIALIZE”, “REMOVE_FAILURES”, “REMOVE_OUTLIERS”, and “REMOVE_EMPTY”.
This means that any plate that is created will perform these basic steps
of removing failed wells, outlier droplets, and empty droplets. Other
plate types inherit the same clusters and steps by default, and can
alter them to be more appropriate for each specific type. For example,
PN/PP plate types use the same clusters, as well as three more: “rain”,
“positive” (PP), and “negative” (PN). PN/PP plate types also use the
same list of steps as the base type, with the addition of steps at the
end to perform droplet gating.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-the-analysis-steps-work" class="section level2">
<h2>How the analysis steps work</h2>
<p>The most important functionality of the <em>ddpcr</em> package is the
ability to programmatically analyze a plate’s droplet data. As described
above, a plate object contains a list of ordered steps that can be
accessed via the <code>steps()</code> command. The value of each element
in the list refers to the name of the function that implements that
analysis step. For example, the last step in the analysis of a basic
plate of type <code>ddpcr_plate</code> is “remove_empty”, which means
that the <code>remove_empty()</code> function is automatically called
when the analysis pipeline reaches this step.</p>
<p>One of the several properties of a plate object that is stored in the
plate’s underlying list object is its status. The status of a plate is
simply an integer that indicates how many analysis steps have been
taken. When a plate is created, the first step of initialization runs
automatically, and the plate’s status is set to one. To analyze a plate,
the <code>analyze()</code> or <code>next_step()</code> functions are
used. The <code>next_step()</code> runs the next step by examining the
plate’s list of steps and its current state to determine what function
to call. The <code>analyze()</code> function can be used to run the full
analysis pipeline on a plate, as it simply calls
<code>next_step()</code> repeatedly until the analysis is completed.</p>
<p>There are several commonalities among all functions that implement
the analysis steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the step functions accept a plate object as input and return a
plate object as output. No other parameters are required to pass to any
step function because all parameters should be contained within the
plate object’s <code>params</code>.</li>
<li>All the steps functions are implemented as generics in order to
allow new plate types to override their logic.</li>
<li>To ensure reproducibility, the random seed is set at the beginning
of every analysis step. This guarantees that even if the same step is
called twice in a row, it will produce identical results.</li>
<li>All step functions must update the status of the returned plate
object to reflect the recently run step.</li>
<li>All step functions call the <code>step_begin()</code> and
<code>step_end()</code> functions to allow the user to see what step is
currently being run and to calculate how long each step takes.</li>
</ul>

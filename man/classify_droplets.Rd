\title{Analysis step: Classify droplets}
\usage{
classify_droplets(plate)
}
\arguments{
\item{plate}{A ddPCR plate.}
}
\value{
A ddPCR plate with all droplets assigned to a cluster. The plate's
metadata will have several new variables.
}
\description{
The main analysis step for ddPCR plates of type \code{pnpp_experiment}.
Classify each droplet as either rain, ++, or +-. Also calculate the frequency
of negative droplets, and attempt to detemine if each well has a statistically
significant number of such droplets.\cr\cr

more information about the algorithm used.
}
\details{
This function is recommended to be run as part of an analysis pipeline (ie.
within the \code{\link[ddpcr]{analyze}} function) rather than being called
directly.
}
\note{
This is an S3 generic, which means that different ddPCR plate types can
implement this function differently.
\href{https://github.com/daattali/ddpcr#advanced-topic-3-creating-new-plate-types}{See the README} for
more information on how to implement custom ddPCR plate types.

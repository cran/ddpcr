\usage{
status(plate)

status(plate) <- value
}
\description{
The status of a plate corresponds to the number of analysis steps that have
taken place. A plate that has been initialized but has not yet been analyzed
at all has status 1.\cr\cr
If you add custom analysis steps to a new plate type, you should make sure
to update the status of the plate after each step. You can use
\code{\link[ddpcr]{check_step}} to ensure that the plate is at an appropriate
status before beginning each step.
